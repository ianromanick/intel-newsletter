This repository contains (or will contain) scans of my personal collection of various Intel employee publications.

My collection includes:

- Intel Pacesetter:
    - January - March 1983
    - October 1983
    - November 1983
    - December 1983 - The year and month do not appear anywhere in this issue. It mentions "1984 will see," and I have both November 1983 and January 1984. From that I infer that this is the December 1983 issue.
    - January 1984
    - February 1984
    - June 1984
    - October 1984
    - March 1985

    - May / June 1985
    - July 1985
    - September 1985
    - December 1985 - The year and month do not appear anywhere in this issue. The cover says "Christmas Issue," and the several articles refer back to 1985.
